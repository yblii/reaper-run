# Reaper Run
Reaper Run is a simple 2D platformer made for a high school group project using the [Minimalist Game Framework](https://github.com/zachbarth/minimalist-game-framework) by [zachbarth](https://github.com/zachbarth). I worked on the project over a period of 5 months with 3 teammates and presented the final product to our class and industry mentors.

I was responsible for the design and implementation of an animation system, uniform grid collision detection, scene management system, achievement system, and most art assets.
